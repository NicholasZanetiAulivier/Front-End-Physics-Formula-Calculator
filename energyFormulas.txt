Done
Kinetic Energy: KE = 0.5mv^2
Gravitational Potential Energy: PE = mgh
Mechanical Energy: E = KE + PE
Electric Potential Energy: E = qV

Should make
Absolute Gravitational Potential Energy: - (G*M1*M2)/r
Conservation of energy: KE+PE = KE+PE
Calorymetry: Q = mcT, Q = mL
Work: F * S * cos a || ( a is the angle between F and the vector of displacement)

Optional (no time)
Rotational Kinetic Energy: KE = 0.5mv^2 + 0.5 I w^2
Absolute Electric Potential Energy: E = (kq1q2)/r
Spring potential Energy: 0.5*k*x^2
